# Practical Java Project

This project contains a series of practical exercises designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in Java programming. Each exercise is implemented in a separate Java file located in the `src` directory. Below is an overview of each practical exercise along with instructions for running the programs.

## Overview of Practical Exercises

1. **Practical1_HelloWorld.java**
   - A simple Java program that displays "Hello World" to the console.
   - Explains the structure of a Java program, including the main method, class declaration, and the compilation and execution steps.

2. **Practical2_PrimitiveDataTypes.java**
   - Demonstrates the use of all Java primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean.
   - Initializes variables of each type and prints their values.

3. **Practical3_StudentDetails.java**
   - Uses the Scanner class to read student details such as name, age, and percentage from user input.
   - Displays the collected information.

4. **Practical4_DistanceConversion.java**
   - Prompts the user to enter a distance in meters and converts it into feet.
   - Displays the result with two decimal places.

5. **Practical5_Operators.java**
   - Demonstrates the use of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators in Java.
   - Includes examples of each type of operator and prints the results.

6. **Practical6_ExpressionEvaluation.java**
   - Evaluates various expressions to demonstrate operator precedence and associativity in Java.
   - Includes examples and prints the results of the evaluations.

7. **Practical7_TypeConversion.java**
   - Demonstrates both implicit and explicit type conversion in Java.
   - Includes examples of each type of conversion and prints the results.

8. **Practical8_CommandLineArguments.java**
   - Accepts two numbers as command-line arguments, converts them to numeric values, performs addition, and displays the result.

## Instructions for Running the Programs

1. **Compile the Java Files:**
   Navigate to the `src` directory in your terminal and compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```

2. **Run the Programs:**
   You can run each program individually using the following command:
   ```
   java PracticalX
   ```
   Replace `X` with the number corresponding to the practical exercise you wish to run (e.g., `Practical1` for the Hello World program).

## Additional Information

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- This project can be extended with additional exercises or modifications to existing ones as needed.

Happy coding!
